            In addition to reflecting our innermost fears, nightmares can also be a warning. For
            example, if a person is feeling overwhelmed or stressed in their life, they may have
            nightmares as a way of alerting them to the fact that they need to take a break and make
            some changes.
            <br />
            <br />
            The exact meaning of nightmares can vary from person to person. Generally, nightmares
            can be seen as a reflection of our innermost fears and anxieties. When we dream, our
            unconscious mind is able to bring out our repressed emotions and unresolved issues.
            Nightmares can also be a way for us to process difficult events or experiences that we
            have had in our lives.
