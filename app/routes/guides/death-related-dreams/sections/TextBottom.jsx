            Dreaming about someone dying can present emotional and psychological challenges,
            including feelings of grief, loss, and potential uncertainty about the significance or
            impact of the dream.

            Teeth can be seen as a sign of strength and power, so if we feel like we are losing
            power in our lives, our subconscious may manifest it as teeth falling out in a dream.

            Emotional Distress

          <MKTypography variant="body2" mb={3}>
            Dreaming about someone&#39;s death, especially if it involves someone you care about,
            can evoke intense emotions such as grief, sadness, or fear. These emotions can be
            distressing and affect your well-being, leading to feelings of anxiety or unease upon
            waking up.

            Anxiety and Fear
          </MKTypography>
          <MKTypography variant="body2" mb={3}>
            Dreams can trigger anxieties and fears related to loss, mortality, or the fragility of
            life. These dreams might leave you feeling unsettled, anxious, or worried about the
            well-being of yourself or your loved ones.

            Guilt and Remorse
          </MKTypography>
          <MKTypography variant="body2" mb={3}>
            If the dream involves someone you have unresolved issues with or have had a complicated
            relationship with, it may evoke feelings of guilt, regret, or remorse. This can bring up
            emotional turmoil and make it challenging to process and move forward from past
            experiences.

            Symbolic Representation
          </MKTypography>
          <MKTypography variant="body2" mb={3}>
            It&#39;s essential to remember that dreams are highly subjective and open to
            interpretation. While dreaming of someone&#39;s death may have symbolic meanings,
            it&#39;s essential to be cautious about over analysing or attributing too much
            significance to the dream, as dreams often incorporate imagery from our subconscious and
            can be influenced by various factors.

            Overall, dreaming about someone&#39;s death can have both pros and cons. It&#39;s
            important to approach these dreams with self-reflection, empathy, and an understanding
            that dreams are personal experiences that may carry different meanings
